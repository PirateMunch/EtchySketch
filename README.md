# EtchySketch
Etch-A-Sketch project

Creating an Etch-A-Sketch following the odin project brief.

getting the inital game working was easy enough. Making it work with various modes and grid size was a challange and required complete code re-write.

making it responsive and to fit on most mobile devices aswell as on large screens has been tough.
