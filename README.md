# EtchySketch
Etch-A-Sketch project

Creating an Etch-A-Sketch is a nice project. I'm old enough to remember them as a child! This will be done thru Dom manipulation and Flexbox's.  
I have actually started to like Flexbox after being fustrated with them for weeks! <<add more boxes will be the answer!>>
Also got very side tracked with my last project and DoM manipulation for fancy buttons.   

lets see how this goes!
